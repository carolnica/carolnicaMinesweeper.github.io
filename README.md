# carolnicaMinesweeper.github.io

This project was me trying to make a Minesweeper game. As you might have noticed, there are many comments in the JavaScript file, reason being it's a code I followed along with on a youtube video. I like to think I learned a lot from this project... There are also features that I added by myself (around 30% of the JS file).
